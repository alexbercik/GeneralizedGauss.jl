    orthogonalize_basis(basis::Dictionary;
                        measure=nothing, quad_order=nothing)

Orthonormalize `basis` with respect to the inner product
``\\langle f,g\\rangle = \\int f(x)\\,g(x)\\,w(x)\\,dx``
using unpivoted Householder QR factorization of the weighted evaluation
matrix.

The algorithm forms ``A_{qi} = \\sqrt{w_q}\\,\\varphi_i(x_q)`` (where
``x_q, w_q`` are Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes and weights
incorporating the measure weight) and computes the thin QR factorization
``A = QR``.  Since ``A^\\top A = R^\\top R = G`` (the Gram matrix), the
upper-triangular ``R`` is the Cholesky factor of ``G`` and the
lower-triangular transformation ``T = R^{-\\top}`` satisfies
``T G T^\\top = I``.

**Why QR of ``A`` instead of Cholesky of ``G``?**  Forming
``G = A^\\top A`` squares the condition number
(``\\kappa(G) = \\kappa(A)^2``), so the Cholesky factor ``L`` of ``G``
carries errors at ``O(\\varepsilon\\,\\kappa(A)^2)``.  Householder QR
applied directly to ``A`` produces ``R`` with errors at
``O(\\varepsilon\\,\\kappa(A))`` — half the digit loss.

**Why unpivoted (not column-pivoted)?**  The continuation algorithm
slices the basis as `dict[1:k]` at each step and requires every prefix
``\\{\\psi_1, \\ldots, \\psi_k\\}`` to be a Chebyshev system.  A
lower-triangular ``T`` guarantees ``\\psi_i`` depends only on
``\\varphi_1, \\ldots, \\varphi_i``, preserving this structure.
Column pivoting would permute the basis ordering, destroying the
prefix-Chebyshev property.

Julia's `qr()` uses a generic Householder implementation that works
natively with `BigFloat`.

By default, the quadrature order is set to ``\\max(2n, 8)`` points,
which is more than sufficient for polynomial and smooth bases.  Pass
`quad_order` explicitly to override this (e.g. for oscillatory or
singular weight functions that need more points).

Returns `(new_basis, T_mat)` where

- `new_basis` is a [`GenericFunctionSet`](@ref) whose functions and
  derivatives are the orthonormalized linear combinations
  ``\\psi_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} T_{ij}\\,\\varphi_j``.
- `T_mat` is the lower-triangular transformation matrix ``R^{-\\top}``.

Pre-computed moments transform by the same matrix:
`new_moments = T_mat * old_moments`.

A warning is printed when the diagonal entries of ``R`` indicate that
the original basis is ill-conditioned, together with an estimate of the
number of decimal digits lost.

# Keyword arguments
- `measure`: callable ``w(x)`` for the measure ``d\\mu = w(x)\\,dx``.
  Default `nothing` (Lebesgue measure).
